# Terminal Recorder + AI Walkthrough Generator  

**Made for my personal use.**  

This tool records my terminal sessions (e.g. while solving HackTheBox labs) and automatically turns them into clean Markdown walkthroughs. No more manually rewriting every step â€” the AI generates explanations of commands and outputs for me.
